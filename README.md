# XamarinExamApp
First Xamarin Interview Exam App

I was required to do the following:
Can you develop a simple two pager Xamarin android application with a splash screen.
The splash screen should be full screen.
Page 1 will be an activity page which will have the contents as shown. Give all the id as proper names – try and name them with the activity name so that it is easier to reference.
Text - “this is a test project”
Image – choose an image
EditText1 – which will allow you to enter only digits.
EditText2 – which will allow you to enter only digits.
Button – “Continue” - once you click on this, the Page 2 Activity will load and the value from the EditText1 and EditText2 will be shown
Page 2 will be another activity where you will have a textview which will show the 2 values and their computed addition
Text will show “You have entered “ + EditText1 + “ + “ + EditText2 + “ = “ + sum of EditText1 and EdiText2
Button – “Back” – to go back to Activity Page 1
Button – “Exit” – to close the app
